SOCKDEBUG(8)
============

NAME
----

sockdebug - simple developer/troubleshooting aid utility to communicate
with a NUT driver using the socket protocol

SYNOPSIS
--------

*sockdebug* socketname

For example (WIN32 and POSIX builds):
	sockdebug.exe dummy-ups-UPS1

For example (POSIX-compliant systems using an alternate state path):
	sockdebug /var/state/ups/dummy-ups-UPS1

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sockdebug* is a tool built when NUT `configure --with-dev` is enabled.
It may alternatively be built by calling `make sockdebug` in the root
of the build workspace. Actual source files used depend on the platform.

It is used to connect to a NUT driver using the socket protocol on an
Unix socket or Windows pipe, similarly to how the linkman:upsd[8] data
server talks to the locally running drivers in order to represent them
on the network further using the common NUT protocol of the Network UPS
Tools project, or how driver programs can communicate to their already
running instances to implement commands like live `reload-or-error`.

This tool allows a developer or troubleshooter to watch the broadcast
updates emitted by the driver, as well as to issue unicast commands and
receive replies (during an interactive investigation session, you may
want to command `NOBROADCAST` first).

For more details see the `docs/sock-protocol.txt` file in NUT sources.

OPTIONS
-------

*libupsclient-config* accepts the following options:

*socketname*::
Either a full path (in POSIX builds) or the base name of device socket/pipe
(on all platforms), comprised of a `drivername-devicename` tuple, e.g. some
`dummy-ups-UPS1` for a `dummy-ups` driver instance handling an `UPS1` device
configuration (which in turn may originate in the `ups.conf` file or be
dynamically constructed for tests by calling the driver program with a
`-s TMP` CLI option).
