NUT resources for systemd integration
=====================================

Overview
--------

This directory contains the NUT support files for `systemd`, the System and
Service Manager used in many Linux distributions.

These files are automatically installed, upon detection (at `configure` time)
of a systemd enabled target system, or if corresponding configuration options
were requested.

This also uses the `nut-driver-enumerator.sh` (service and implementation
method) and `upsdrvsvcctl` (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances
located in `../upsdrvsvcctl/` source subdirectory.
